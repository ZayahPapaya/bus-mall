### Reflections and Comments

- Bus Mall is a fun project with some troublesome points. I found it more difficult to pick up a different bus mall and work on it over just writing my own.
- Initially, localstorage was a bit of a pain to wrap my head around but quickly became quite easy. Especially with my abominable global object methods in play!
- I cannot stand Chart.js's documentation. It is absolutely barebones and a pain in my rear to find the actual syntax required. It took far too long to even add a simple color.
